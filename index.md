## About me

I am a Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst working for an MSSP in UK with a previous background in Control Systems Engineering. My key focus in the current role is around adversary infrastructure tracking and have recently started my journey towards Malware Analysis with a focus on C2s. I love Python and want to get better at it. 

That is all from me now, if you are interested in the security research that I undertake then have a look at my Twitter handle [@RustyNoob619](https://twitter.com/RustyNoob619) as I am pretty active there. Also check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/RustyNoob-619/100-Days-of-YARA-2024) for some YARA. I intend to push more interesting projects but no promises yet
